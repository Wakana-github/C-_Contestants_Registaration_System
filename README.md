### Discription
This is an event management system built with C# that I created as part of my course assignment. It allows users to register contestant information and view the list of contestants in each category.
<br>First, the system prompts the user to enter the number of contestants for the current year and the previous year, then returns a sentence based on the comparison of these numbers.
<br>Next, the user can register contestant names and select the categories in which they will participate.
<br>Finally, the user can view the list of contestants for their chosen category.
